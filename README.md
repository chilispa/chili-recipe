# Chili Recipe: the Chili Team Learning Path

This is the learning path every new developer has to follow when joining the Chili team.

This path reflects our team's culture and values, which have their roots in the [agile values and principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/), as well as in those of XP, and in the [software craftsmanship manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/).

## Main learning path

### 1) Methodology
* Read [Way to the cake: the Agile is a Lie learning path](https://github.com/chilispa/way-to-the-cake)
* Read [Test-Driven Development](/study-path/methodologies/test_driven_development/tdd.md)
    

### 2) Systems architecture
* Read how to write a well-designed [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design)

### 3) Best practises
