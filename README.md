# Chili Recipe: the Chili Team Learning Path

This is the learning path every new developer has to follow when joining the Chili team.

This path reflects our team's culture and values, which have their roots in the [agile values and principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/), as well as in those of XP, and in the [software craftsmanship manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/).

## Main learning path

### 1) Methodology
* Read [Way to the cake: the Agile is a Lie learning path](https://github.com/chilispa/way-to-the-cake)

### 2) Systems architecture
* Read how to write a well-designed [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design)

### 3) Best practises
1. Project Structure:
    * resources
    * services
    * repositories
    * models
    * common (Constants, Exceptions, etc.)
    * kafka
    
2. The length of the files is less than 200 lines of code.
3. The names of the classes and interfaces are CamelCase.
4. Write Meaningful Names for Variables and Functions.
5. Constants should be uppercase.
6. Formatting and readability.
7. Unit tests, are the guardians of your code quality.
8. <b>KISS</b>: Keep It Simple Stupid. A design principle from the US Navy that dates back to the 1960s. He claims that most systems should be kept as simple as possible. (x Alberto)
9. <b>DRY</b>: Don't Repeat Yourself. It states that every piece of code must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.
10. <b>YAGNI</b>: You Aren't Gonna Need It. A developer should not add functionality unless deemed necessary.
11. Boy scout rule, Leave the code cleaner than you found it.
